# 👋 Hi, I'm Waren Gador  

💻 ** Full-Stack Engineer | OSS Contributor**  

💻 Staff Software Engineer | Full-Stack Architect | OSS Contributor

I’m a passionate engineer who turns ideas into secure, scalable, and elegant software systems.
My expertise spans from frontend architecture to backend infrastructure, with deep roots in TypeScript, Go Fiber, and modern web performance engineering.

What defines my work is craftsmanship and clarity — I design systems that are fast, secure, and maintainable, without sacrificing developer experience.

I'm also the Creator of Vanilla TS SSR Package that allows you to make your website frameworkless and support zustand state management with filebased systems.

my main focus

CSRF | RSP | Refresh Tokens | Session ID's - Token AES-GCM Encryption

I focus on these deep understanding of architectural security api by. design 

- Cookies must be important concept in where you need to understand what is HTTPOnly, SameSite, Secured, Domain, Path and Partition.
- RSA Signature Cryptography is dynamically change every login session by the user.
- Secrets are dynamically change every 5 mins which is hard to manipulate
- Content Security Policy - Most important header to avoid Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- Trusted-types - only trusted elements allowed
- Cloudflare Firewall

I also make reusable hooks, components and folder structure
- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
- Separation Concerns
- Accessibility
- UI/UX Design
- SEO (100%) - Deep understanding of SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION metadatas
